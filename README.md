# NinjaArena

Team vs Team vs Enemies arena plugin for PaperMC: walk through a portal, outplay rival
teams and the horde, and return to where you left.

NinjaArena targets Paper 26.3 and does not run on Folia.

## Building

Requires JDK 25, which paper-api 26.3 is built for. Gradle finds a matching local JDK
through its toolchain support; the wrapper downloads Gradle itself.

```sh
./gradlew build
```

On Windows, use `gradlew.bat build`. The plugin JAR is written to `build/libs/`, and
`./gradlew test` runs the unit tests on their own.

## Icon artwork

The geometry master is `docs/assets/icon-master.svg`. All other SVG and PNG icons
are exported from it; edit the master and run `node scripts/export-icons.mjs`.
The exporter requires Node.js 22 or newer and installs its pinned rasterizer under
the ignored `build/icon-tools/` directory on first use.

Run `node --test scripts/export-icons.test.mjs` for the geometry and export tests,
and `node scripts/export-icons.mjs --check` to verify the committed exports.
The small cut covers 16–64 px, including a 20 px preview. Full-size, rounded,
transparent light and dark, and monochrome variants live beside the master.

GPL-3.0. See [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).
